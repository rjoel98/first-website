        <section><p> In theUSA, approximately 1 in 10 children will be sexually abused          
            before their 18th birthday. That is too many!!</p>

        <p>We believe every child has a right to be free from any kind of abuse! </p>

        <p>Our mission is to bring education and training to all youth serving professionals, child advocates, parents, and communities by providing training, tools and resources to become educated about child sex abuse prevention (csa). </p>

        <p>In partnership with Darkness To Light, Stewards of Children, we are committed to equipping organizations, adults and children with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively protect all children from sexual abuse. By educating adults, we empower children with the skills to fight back and or tell if the need arrises. Only when we change the rules, systems, structures and the way we talk about csa, can the potential of every child be realized. The only way we can eliminate child sexual abuse is by making prevention a priority! It's the secret that keeps the abuse going!</p></section>

       <section><p>We encourage communities, schools, youth centers, churchs, etc. to contact us and sign up for a class on how to be aware and pro-active and challenge everyone to openly talk about the risks and preventions.</p>

        <p>When people have the training and knowledge about child sexual abuse (csa), and when we all are empowered to overcome the fear, denial, stigma, and obstacles around standing up for children on this subject, I know we all will choose to do the right thing....for all children!</p>

        <p>Everyone can be an advocate for Child Sexual Abuse Prevention!</p>
